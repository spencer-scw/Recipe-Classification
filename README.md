# Recipe-Classification
My Machine Learning class term project.

This repository contains the notebooks that I used to try and predict the mealtime (breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert) of recipes from Food.com based on their ingredients list. I used several machine learning techniques and found a support vector machine to be the most suitable for the task.
