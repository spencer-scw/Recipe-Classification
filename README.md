# Recipe-Classification
My Machine Learning class term project.

This repository contains the notebooks that I used to try and predict the mealtime (breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert) of recipes from Food.com based on their ingredients list. I used several machine learning techniques and found a support vector machine to be the most suitable for the task.

The dataset isn't here, but it came from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/foodcom-recipes-with-search-terms-and-tags/data.

The ANN_classification notebook is where I created an ANN. The Food_Classification is the main notebook where I did feature engineering and fit the supervised models. There are also various project files and documents here.
